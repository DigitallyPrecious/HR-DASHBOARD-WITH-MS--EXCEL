# HR-DASHBOARD-WITH-MS--EXCEL
I created a dashboard containing data reports from the human resource department for a hypothetical business using MS Excel.
The Sales Dashboard is designed to provide a hypothetical business owner with a comprehensive overview of their staff activities. It offers insights into the number of employees by sex, top positions employed by the firm, recruitment sources, and how the staff is divided into departments in the firm. 
Its features include visualization of employee details, salaries, positions occupied in the firm, etc. 
To interact with the dashboard, please make sure you have Microsoft Excel installed on your device. The data used in this dashboard is hypothetically generated.
